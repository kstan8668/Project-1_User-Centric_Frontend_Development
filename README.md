##  Guitar Studio
Assignment One: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 


Guitar Studio website Problems:
Mr. Goh from Guitar Studio requested to me to revamp his website, https://fredrickgohkh.wixsite.com/website. He shared with me his website cannot get any prospect interest to contact him and not really responsive . He is always very busy with his students or meeting and he will handle all request himself only.    
My proposal of above challenge is to build a simple landing page cover five sections as Testimonials Gallery Our Rate and About Us  This website will be only an English version. 


** Demo

## UX
I designed keep it simple “as a glance” landing page concept to minimise scrolling of the content.  My objective is getting the prospect interest to call him as his requested he will personally handle any call or email from website.  The bule mix with green colour scheme was provision a sleek feel. Click on the right top button, About us and Contact us will be shown, easy for prospect to brief understand the studio and to contact him. This website is focus on call of interest, Hotline button to allow any prospect to call him for enquiry. 

** Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap (v4.3.1)


##  Features
This site used ‘at a glance’ concept given less click and scrolling in Bootstrap with an extra Jumbotron function less smooth scrolling effect. As want to be difference, there is only one nav button, just client it and About Us & Contact Us will show, other area like Testimony and Tagline info will be fill within one desktop screen as minimised design. On the mobile, it will be responsive on all sections. Make it easy to scroll and read.


##  Features Left to Implement 
An e-commerce platform would be implement to allow student to purchase guitar, basic guitar course and Ukulele too!. More comprehensive sections will be adding animations and sound effect on a hover, and a blog will be adding into it. I would like to propose a reward system into his future website to earn points and exchange items.


##  Testing
I have shown Mr. Goh on this website and he was pleased on this “at a glance’ simple design concept and I have achieved provided him to showcase his visual retail. He was very happy I provide a short content when viewing on a desktop between 13 to 17” screen, and more responsive & stable website then his current website.  I will put this website live version in GitHub repository. https://github.com/kstan8668/Project-1_User-Centric_Frontend_Development.git
